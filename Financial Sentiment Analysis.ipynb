Contracts for Japan rose. Chinese stocks may gain for a second day, as a gauge of US-listed mainland shares climbed more than 2%, after Bloomberg reported Donald Trump’s incoming team is considering gradual tariff hikes.\\n\\nThe dollar dropped for the first time in six sessions after the tariff report, and as data showed that US wholesale inflation unexpectedly cooled. Australian bonds slipped in early Asia trading after the yield on 10-year Treasuries inched higher to 4.79%.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the consumer price index (CPI), the S&P 500 closed little changed after it swung between gains and losses, weighed by big tech. Options traders are bracing for the benchmark’s busiest CPI day since March 2023. The index is expected to move 1% in either direction on Jan 15, based on the cost of at-the-money puts and calls, according to Stuart Kaiser at Citigroup Inc.\\n\\n“All eyes are now on Wednesday’s CPI report, which may be the most important inflation reading in recent memory, as it will fuel the market’s Fed-obsessed sentiment,” said Chris Brigati at SWBC. “A strong inflation number adds to this idea of no cuts in 2025, and potentially even a rate hike, while a weak inflation data point may help to calm the market’s Fed fears.”\\n\\nUnderlying US inflation probably cooled only a touch at the close of 2024 against a backdrop of a resilient job market and steadfast economy, supporting the Fed’s go-slow approach to further rate cuts.\\n\\nThe report is likely to cause ripples through global markets after successive data prints indicating a robust US economy caused Treasury yields to spike, as bets on Fed easing were trimmed. In Asia, stocks have dropped 2.8% this year, while a gauge of the region’s currencies has slid 0.4% amid persistent dollar strength. Fears over the incoming Trump administration’s tariff policies have also weighed.\\n\\nTraders will be closely watching Bank Indonesia’s (BI) policy decision later on Wednesday for clues to how the region is adapting to the uncertainty of the Fed’s path and the new US administration. All economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the central bank to keep its key rate at 6%, after it made repeated interventions to stablise its currency over the past month.\\n\\n“The uncertain global environment presents additional complexity to the region’s central banks fiscal and monetary dynamics,” said Alicia Chu, a portfolio manager at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “With this backdrop, BI may extend its rate pause with 50 basis points of rate cuts pushed back to 2H2025.”\\n\\nIn South Korea, authorities made a second attempt to arrest impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law decree in December.\\n\\nBank earnings\\n\\nElsewhere, Eurozone industrial production data is due ahead of the US inflation reading. Wall Street is also gearing up for the unofficial start of the earnings season, with results from big banks hitting the tape on Wednesday.\\n\\nLenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co are expected to show continued gains from trading and investment banking, which helped offset net interest income declines caused by higher deposits and sluggish loan demand.\\n\\n“When it comes to big-bank earnings, net interest income is the key data point to watch,” Brigati at SWBC said. “If banks have been able to take advantage of borrowing at cheaper rates versus their loan portfolio, this is a constructive sign for the coming year.”\\n\\nIn commodities, oil gained after slipping from a five-month high on Tuesday, as Hamas and Israel tentatively agreed to a ceasefire, cooling a rally fuelled by risks to Russian and Iranian supplies.

Airfares, however, jumped by the most since March 2022.\\n\\nStubborn inflation in the closing months of 2024, combined with a resilient job market, encouraged Fed policymakers to dial back their expectations for interest-rate cuts this year.\\n\\nFood prices\\n\\nThe PPI report showed a 0.1% decline in food prices, including a nearly 15% slide in the cost of vegetables. Egg prices, which soared nearly 56% in November due to a worsening bird influenza outbreak, barely rose last month. Energy prices advanced 3.5%.\\n\\nOverall goods prices increased 0.6% after advancing 0.7% a month earlier.

Tuesday’s auction was oversubscribed 3.06 times as the historically high compensation attracted investors.\\n\\nReeves speaks\\n\\nThere won’t be any let-up in the sales. Tuesday’s offering will be followed by a £4 billion auction of 10-year notes on Wednesday. Next week will see a sale of three-year debt as well as an offering through banks of bonds maturing in 2040.\\n\\nAnd the final week of January will conclude with sales of 10-year inflation-linked securities, green debt and a Bank of England operation to sell long-maturity bonds from its holdings purchased during the era of quantitative easing.\\n\\nReeves will speak to lawmakers later on Tuesday for the first time since last week’s turmoil. Traders will be watching for any pointers on how she plans to rebuild fiscal headroom, with Bloomberg Economics estimating that she needs to find as much £12 billion.\\n\\nBeyond that, investors turn their attention to a slew of key data, including inflation on Wednesday that could decide whether the market turbulence resumes. US inflation numbers are slated for the same day, and overnight implied volatility in sterling is on course for its second-highest close in nearly two years.\\n\\n“The next 72 hours will be crucial for UK assets,” said Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB.\\n\\nReeves “will likely be pressed on the sell-off in the pound and in UK bonds”, while an uptick in inflation could hoist gilt yields further, she said.'),\n",
